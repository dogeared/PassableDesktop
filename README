Memorizing lots of passwords sucks.
Writing down passwords sucks.
Using the same password everywhere sucks.
Using password vaults sucks.
Two factor authentication is expensive. And, therefore, sucks.

How it works:

With Passable, you remember a long base phrase that only you know. Something
like:

The rain in spain falls mainly on the plain
(But make up your own)

Whenever you need a password, you use a short identifier. For instance, for a
gmail account, the identifier might be:

gmail bob
(But make up your own)

Passable generates a very strong password which is copied to the clipboard.
You donâ€™t even need to look at the generated password, although you can if you
really want to. You just paste it in where you need it.

Every site you use gets a different password without you having to remember
different passwords for every site.

Some technical details:

-The app is written using Appcelerator Titanium: http://www.appcelerator.com/
-A pure javascript sha1 library is used to encode passwords
-For "Superman Strong" (40 chars) and "Very Strong" (20 chars) modes, hex
  encoding is used.
-For "Extremely Strong" (28 chars) and "Strong" (14 chars) modes, b64 encoding
  is used.
